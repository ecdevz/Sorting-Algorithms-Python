# Sorting Algorithms Program

## Description
This project implements various sorting algorithms to demonstrate their working principles and performance. It includes a Python program that allows users to sort data using different algorithms and visualize the process through flowcharts and pseudocode.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Clear and concise pseudocode for each algorithm
- Flowcharts illustrating the algorithmic steps
- Easy-to-run Python script for sorting demonstration

## File Structure
- `main.py`: The main Python script containing the sorting algorithm implementations and program logic.
- `flowchart_and_pseudocode/`: Directory containing flowchart images and pseudocode files for the sorting algorithms.
  - `flowchart.drawio.svg`: Flowchart diagram illustrating the sorting algorithms.
  - `pseudocode.pseu`: Pseudocode representation of the sorting algorithms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the main script using the command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select and run sorting algorithms.
